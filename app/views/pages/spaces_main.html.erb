		This is where you would keep track of your lease(s).  From here you would be able to view or download the actual lease copy and/or update the particulars of your lease.  If you haven't become a member yet, <%= link_to 'click here', new_user_registration_path %>, otherwise <%= link_to 'sign-in', new_user_session_path %> to start tracking your space(s).

	<h3>Space Feed</h3>
	<p>
		Once a member and you've selected other spaces to track, this area would show a list of recent communications/posts related to the spaces you're tracking...kind of like a Twitter feed.
